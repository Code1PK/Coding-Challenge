# [Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

### Understanding the problem

You are given a `large integer` represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.
Increment the large integer by one and return the `resulting array of digits`.

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> digits = [1,2,3]
<b>Output:</b> [1,2,4]
<b>Explanation:</b> The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
<b>Input:</b> digits = [4,3,2,1]
<b>Output:</b> [4,3,2,2]
<b>Explanation:</b> The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
