# [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### Understanding the problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may assume that each input would have `exactly one solution`, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order. 

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
<b>Output:</b> [0,1]
<b>Input:</b> nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
<b>Output:</b> [1,2]
<b>Input:</b> nums = [3,3], target = 6
<b>Output:</b> [0,1]
</pre>
